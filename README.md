# expense-project
Supposed to be a fullstack project where the api is built with java and mysql on the back, and front end done with js, css, react. There will be a form 
users can input their name, cost/amount and reason for the expense reimbursement, and another page/form that allows a user to go over the forms and 
approve and deny the requests. Deletion should only be available if the forms are no longer pending and rows not be able to be edited unless deleted 
once the submission has been approved/denied. 
DeadLine = 7-22-22. @ about 25% completion :(
